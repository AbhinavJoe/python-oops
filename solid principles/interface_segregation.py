"""
ðŸ“Œ Question:
Design a Worker interface (or abstract base class in Python) with methods like work(), eat(), sleep().
Then create HumanWorker that does all these, and RobotWorker that should not be forced to implement eat() or sleep().
Refactor the interfaces so classes only implement what they need.
